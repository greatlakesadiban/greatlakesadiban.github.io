*4:00–6:00: Poetry reading in memoriam Franklin Lewis*

The University of Chicago and the wider Adiban community recently lost a cherished member, Professor Franklin Lewis. Frank was widely loved and respected, and as a community we are still mourning this enormous loss. You can read a full memorial statement [here](https://nelc.uchicago.edu/memorial-statement-franklin-lewis).

Among his many contributions, Frank was a co-founder of and keen participant in the Great Lakes Adiban Society. I know many of you knew him personally or professionally. As such, together with the NELC department, we thought it would be fitting to add a small event in his memory to the workshop proceedings. We will gather with other members of the NELC community for a poetry reading between 4–6pm on Saturday afternoon (location TBA). We suggest that those who wish to do so read a poem, in the original or in translation, that they feel suits the occasion. It could be something that Frank translated or something you like and think he would. This is not intended as an official memorial service (that will take place later this year), but rather as an intimate gathering to begin to mourn a man who meant so much to so many of us.
