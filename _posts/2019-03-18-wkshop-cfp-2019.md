**Call for Paper Proposals: The 3rd Great Lakes Adiban Workshop in IU Bloomington**

The [Great Lakes Adiban Society (GLAS)](https://greatlakesadiban.github.io/) invites submissions for its third annual workshop, scheduled to take place at Indiana University Bloomington, on **September 28--29, 2019**. We welcome papers that are works in progress and would benefit from extensive discussion and feedback, and especially encourage graduate students to participate.

The Society aims to provide a regional forum for scholars of Islamicate *adab*, particularly of the medieval and early modern periods, to meet and share their work. We leave our parameters of language and genre intentionally open in order to invite as wide a collaboration as can be useful, but as a group we are generally interested in the literary production of the broad complex of premodern Muslim societies across the Eastern Hemisphere. This naturally includes the major Islamicate languages of Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu, as well as many others (Armenian, Georgian, Hebrew, Spanish, etc.) that participate in similar literary conventions.

Those who wish to participate can apply by filling out our online application at [**tinyurl.com/GLAS2019**](https://tinyurl.com/GLAS2019) by **June 21, 2019**. Please note that each accepted participant will be given 45 minutes to present and discuss their work; because of this, we have limited space and may have to turn down some submissions if we get too many. In such an event, preference will generally be given to scholars in the Great Lakes region, per the [mission](https://greatlakesadiban.github.io/about/) of this organization. While all participants are asked to cover the costs of travel and lodging, we will provide breakfasts, lunches, and at least one dinner over the course of the workshop. In addition, we hope to be able to offer small grants ($250) to offset graduate student travel expenses. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to write Cameron Cross at `kchalipa` [at] `umich.edu`. We look forward to hearing from you!
