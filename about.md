## Background 

The Great Lakes Adiban Society is an informal academic organization intended to provide a regional forum for scholars of Islamicate *adab*, particularly of the medieval and early modern periods. By "Islamicate," we mean the literatures and literary practices cultivated in languages like Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Urdu, Bengali and so on; other traditions that are not majority-Muslim but nevertheless participate in this general discourse include (but are certainly not limited to) Armenian, Baluchi, Georgian, Hebrew, Kurdish, Punjabi, and Spanish. By sponsoring panels at conferences and convening regular workshops, we hope to facilitate the exchange of ideas, give scholars a chance to critique and refine each other’s work, and foster a sense of community in the Great Lakes region.

## Activities to Date

Since our founding in the summer of 2016, we have sponsored annual panels at the [International Congress on Medieval Studies](https://wmich.edu/medievalcongress) in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and have also convened an annual workshop at various universities in the Great Lakes region. You can find the more detailed information about these events by finding their announcements on our main page.
